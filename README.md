## Features

Archon is a small bar that sits at the bottom of your Mac/Windows screen where you can type what you want your computer to do in natural language. It takes screenshots to see what's on screen, uses GPT-5's reasoning to plan, then a custom fine-tuned model executes clicks and keystrokes. In a racing game demo with a single instruction to 'start playing' it recognized the view, used WASD, and navigated the track. Although it didnâ€™t win this time due to latency, its instruction-following ability was clearly superior to prior models. The goal is to make a copilot that makes computers self-driving. Archon is a lightweight client demonstrating that GPT-5â€™s powerful reasoning combined with tiny fine-tuned models can control any interface through natural language.
